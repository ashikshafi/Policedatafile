##Traffic Stops by Race and GenderÂ¶##

I am analyzing a dataset of traffic stops in all over the United States. The dataset is available at https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/. In this dataset, I am analyzing traffic stops in Texas only. The dataset has around 2 million rows and is 5GB in size.
